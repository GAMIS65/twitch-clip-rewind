# Twitch Clip Rewind
Project for [TimeEnjoyed](https://twitch.tv/timeenjoyed)'s codejam

Look back in **time** at your best stream highlights.

A simple website that "generates" a "rewind" from your most viewed Twitch clips from a specific time period.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Get your Twitch client ID and client secret from [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create), and put them into the `.env.local` file.

To run in dev mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To run in production mode:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
